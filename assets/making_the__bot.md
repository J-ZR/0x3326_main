## Creating a Server
On discord, create a server and call it what ever you want, for this example it'll be called "bot server".<br />

## Making the Bot
Go to the discord development portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications/)<br />
Click on "New Application" then name your bot and click create. (You can customize it to have a profile picture)<br />

### OAuth2 & Bot
Once you've created the bot, you'll be on the "General Informations" tab. Nagivate to the "Bot" tab on the left hand side menue bar.
