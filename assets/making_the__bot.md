## Creating a Server
On discord, create a server and call it what ever you want, for this example it'll be called "bot server".<br />

## Making the Bot
Go to the discord development portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications/)<br />
Click on "New Application" then name your bot and click create. (You can customize it to have a profile picture)<br />
Click on "Copy" to copy the token. This should not be shared or be made public. If it doesn't say copy, click on "reset token" <br />and save that somewhere.

### OAuth2 & Bot
Once you've created the bot, you'll be on the "General Informations" tab. Nagivate to the "Bot" tab on the left hand side menue bar.
Scroll down to where it says "Bot Permissions" and click on "Administrator". (You can chose your own desired settings if you like <br />
for the sake of the tutorial, simply click on "Administrator").

### OAuth2
Now nagigate to the "OAuth2" tab. Scroll down to the "OAuth2 URL Generator". Find the option on the "scope" section that says "bot" and select the box. <bt />
A new option will appear under the previous one called "Bot Permissions". There, select the desired permissions. 

Once you do that scroll down to the bottom where it says "Generate URL", there should be a URL generated, copy it and paste on a browser. <br />

### Inviting the bot
Once you've done that, on the link it generated it'll ask you to chose which server to invite the bot, select one anc click "continue". <br />
Following that, it'll show you a quick recap of the permissions you selected to confirm, if everything looks good, click on "authorize". <br />
A message will appear saying it was done succesfully. Now simply go to your server.
